# Your First Native LiveView

Now that you've [installed LiveView Native](./installation.md), its time to create a LiveView
that uses it. This guide explains how to create a basic LiveView module that can serve different
templates to both HTML and native platforms while sharing non-template code between them.

## A basic LiveView

> #### Info {: .info}
> For more information on LiveView in general, see the docs for `Phoenix.LiveView` [here](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html).

To begin, create a new LiveView module and add it to your Phoenix router. The path for this LiveView
should be identical to the path you chose when setting up your native client app (this defaults to `"/"`,
when using `mix lvn.install` to install LiveView Native).

First create a new LiveView somewhere in your app that inherits `LiveViewNative.LiveView`, like so:

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/live/hello_live.ex
defmodule MyAppWeb.HelloLive do
  use Phoenix.LiveView
  use LiveViewNative.LiveView

  @impl true
  def render(%{} = assigns) do
    # This UI renders on the web
    ~H"""
    <div class="flex w-full h-screen items-center">
      <span class="w-full text-center">
        Hello web!
      </span>
    </div>
    """
  end
end
```

Then, add it to your app's router:

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/router.ex
defmodule MyAppWeb.Router do
  use MyAppWeb, :router

  ### Pipelines, etc.
  
  scope "/", MyAppWeb do
    pipe_through :browser

    ### Other routes...

    live "/", HelloLive
  end

  ### Routes for LiveDashboard, Swoosh, etc.
end
```

Then, run your app and navigate to your local development server in a web browser.
You should see the LiveView you created.

## A native LiveView

To support non-web platforms using LiveView Native, simply provide a template for each
platform you want to support. This is done by extending LiveView's standard `render/1` callback.

Each platform will have its own custom `:platform_id`, render sigil and HEEx syntax, which are
all pulled in by the `LiveViewNative.LiveView` macro inherited toward the top of your LiveView.
The following example demonstrates handling the `:swiftui` platform for LiveView Native apps
with the `:live_view_native_swift_ui` dependency, which covers iOS, iPadOS and macOS support:

```elixir
# lib/my_app_web/live/hello_live.ex
defmodule MyAppWeb.HelloLive do
  use Phoenix.LiveView
  use LiveViewNative.LiveView

  @impl true
  def render(%{platform_id: :swiftui} = assigns) do
    # This UI renders on the iPhone / iPad app
    ~SWIFTUI"""
    <VStack>
      <Text>
        Hello native!
      </Text>
    </VStack>
    """
  end

  @impl true
  def render(%{} = assigns) do
    # This UI renders on the web
    ~H"""
    <div class="flex w-full h-screen items-center">
      <span class="w-full text-center">
        Hello web!
      </span>
    </div>
    """
  end
end
```

Loading the native project at `native/swiftui/MyApp/MyApp.xcodeproj` and running it in
Simulator will render the native template in various devices for the SwiftUI platform:

### iPadOS

### macOS

### Web

If everything looks as it should, congratulations! Your app is now using LiveView Native to
serve multiple platform-specific templates to both web and non-web clients.

## What's next?

If you've reached this section of the guide, you should have a cursory understanding of LiveView
Native, how to install it in an existing Phoenix project and how to write a basic "Hello World"
LiveView that renders a different UI for web and non-web clients.

To use LiveView Native to its full potential, you will need to dig deeper into the following subjects:

1. LiveView Native features and concepts
2. Additional libraries for the platform(s) your app supports
3. Building UIs for the platform(s) your app support

This guide will cover the first point in the pages to follow. For the other two, you will need to consult the
relevant documentation, guides and supporting literature for the platform(s) you want your app to serve. Below
are some recommended resources for the SwiftUI and Jetpack platforms:
